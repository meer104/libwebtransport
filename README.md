## Overview

WebTransport allows web applications to exchange data with a server over HTTP/3. This protocol can deliver lower latency compared to traditional methods, enabling seamless media streaming and real-time interactions. **libwebtransport** provides developers with the tools needed to integrate this technology into their applications using C/C++.

## Features

- **Low Latency**: Ideal for applications that require fast data exchange.
- **Multiplexed Streams**: Support for multiple streams over a single connection.
- **0-RTT Connections**: Reduced latency for repeat connections.
- **Media Stream Support**: Easy integration of media streams into applications.
- **QUIC and TLS**: Built on modern transport protocols ensuring secure and efficient communication.

## Getting Started

To get started with **libwebtransport**, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- A C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or similar)
- CMake for building the project
- Dependencies for QUIC and HTTP/3 libraries

### Installation

You can clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/meer104/libwebtransport.git
cd libwebtransport
```

## Usage

Using **libwebtransport** is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example to get you started:

```cpp
#include <libwebtransport.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize WebTransport
    WebTransport transport = WebTransport::Create("https://example.com");

    // Create a stream
    auto stream = transport.CreateStream();

    // Send data
    stream.Send("Hello, WebTransport!");

    // Receive data
    stream.Receive();

    return 0;
}
```

This simple example illustrates how to initialize a WebTransport connection, create a stream, send, and receive data. You can build upon this foundation to create complex applications.

## Building the Library

To build **libwebtransport**, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are in the root directory of the cloned repository.
2. Create a build directory:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```

3. Run CMake:

```bash
cmake ..
```

4. Compile the library:

```bash
make
```

After the build process completes, you will find the library files in the `build` directory.
